# Alphaboard Projects

Exciting and fun projects built using the **Alphaboard** development board by [@fbiego](https://github.com/fbiego).

## Beginner Projects

###  Project 1: Servo Arm Control with Potentiometers  
Control two servo motors using the onboard potentiometers on the Alphaboard.  
This project demonstrates basic analog input reading and PWM output for servo control.

**Features:**
- Real-time control of servo angles  
- Uses two built-in potentiometers

###  Project 2: Hogwarts Alarm  
A magical alarm that greets the sunrise with the iconic **Hogwarts theme**!

**How it works:**
- Place the device on your window at night.  
- When sunlight hits the light sensor in the morning, it triggers the Hogwarts theme to play.  
- To stop the alarm, either unplug the device or adjust the potentiometer to reduce light sensor sensitivity.

**Additional Notes:**
- Light sensitivity is adjustable via the onboard potentiometer.  
- Tunes are **hardcoded manually**
